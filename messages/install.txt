GNU Octave Completions (GnuOC)
==============================

About
=====

  This Sublime Text (2 or 3) package gives method completion suggestions for GNU Octave.


How to Use
==========

Just type the words and the completion suggestions should show up. If you still don't understand how to use it. Just flow along.

Note: For best result, you can disable Matlab Completions (if installed) so that only the GNU methods would show up in the completion lists.
